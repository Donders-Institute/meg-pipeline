The analysis pipelines and settings for the algorithms represented in this repository are merely a *template* for how you **could do** your analysis at the DCCN, not how you **should do** your analysis.

You should train yourself about the different options that you have for data processing and you should understand that the **optimal data processing pipeline** is always dependent on the research question,  the experimental design and on the features of the data that you have acquired.

You should always consult and inform your supervisor or principal investigator on the decisions that you make in data processing.
