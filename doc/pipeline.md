## Data analysis pipeline sequence

The processing pipelines of EEG and MEG data share many aspects, that is why we largely use the same analysis scripts. Where needed, e.g. for co-registration between MEG and MRI, or re-referencing of EEG, there are separate scripts that need to be executed at the right moment in the pipeline.
