# M/EEG data analysis templates

This repository contains some (non-exhaustive) template EEG and MEG data analysis functions, pipelines and scripts to organize the data and data analysis. These can serve as examples to organize your own data handling, but are by no means THE only way in which it can be done. Specific scientific questions might require other analysis approaches.
